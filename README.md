### Lake of the Ozarks
This is my first trip in U.S and had amazing vacation - Lake of the Ozarks, lake in south-central Missouri, U.S., in the **scenic Ozark Mountains** about 42 miles (68 km) southwest of Jefferson City. One of the largest artificial lakes in the U.S, it is impounded by Bagnell Dam, built across the Osage River to provide hydroelectric power for the St. Louis area. Covering an area of 93 square miles (241 square km), the lake is approximately 90 miles (145 km) long and has a shoreline of more than 1,100 miles (1,770 km). **The lake, with facilities for fishing and aquatic sports, is a popular recreation and resort area**. There are several limestone caverns nearby. Lake of the Ozarks State Park includes most of the Grand Glaize arm of the lake, with 90 miles (145 km) of shoreline. Ha Ha Tonka State Park is on the Niangua arm, to the south.
